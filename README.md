**Simple Bunq API Chat**

Hey, this is a test assignment for bunq. 

**Commands**

```
yarn
yarn start
yarn test
yarn build
```

**Goals**

In this test task I wanted to achieve scalability,
so I chose react/redux and a spread architecture rather
than putting everything in a single folder. Also I tried to implement 
some best practices like virtual and lazy loading lists.

**Blockers**

Main blocker that I've experienced is the virtual, lazy-loading list
that scrolls up (like messages view in Telegram, WhatsApp).
When a new portion of data is rendered, the list would jump.
I decided to postpone implementing this task and use a usual lazy-loading
list.

**Progress**

I won't lie, this task took me about 2.5 working days to complete.
That seems too much, especially when you see a line "Keep in mind that you need 3 hours to complete the assignment.", 
but I've been trying to be attentive to details, so I hope you'll enjoy.
